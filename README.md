# ring-disposal

`destroy-the-ring.sh` was our first attempt to destroy the One Ring, but that
was only an alpha release. We're working on a new solution, and hope to release
something very shortly.

```bash
if ./destroy-the-ring.sh; then echo 'Success!'; else echo "Let's try a different plan."; fi
```

It was worth a shot.
